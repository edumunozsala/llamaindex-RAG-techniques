This method addresses the challenge of enabling LLMs to effectively utilize external knowledge sources in an efficient multistep reasoning process, by decoupling reasoning and the retrieval of granular knowledge.\n","\n","While tools aid LLMs in accessing external knowledge, fine-tuning LLM agents to adeptly invoke tools in multi-step reasoning poses challenges. Interconnected tool calls necessitate comprehensive and efficient tool usage planning. CoA presents a novel strategy for LLMs to optimize tool utilization in multi-step reasoning scenarios. The method involves training LLMs to initially decode reasoning chains using abstract placeholders. Subsequently, domain-specific tools are employed to concretize each reasoning chain by filling in specific knowledge.\n","\n","Planning with abstract chains enables LLMs to learn more generalized reasoning strategies. These strategies exhibit robustness to shifts in domain knowledge, such as mathematical results relevant to diverse reasoning questions. Furthermore, CoA facilitates parallel decoding and tool calling, mitigating inference delays associated with awaiting tool responses.\n","\n","The chain-of-abstraction (CoA) LlamaPack implements a generalized version of the strategy. By prompting the LLM to write function calls in a chain-of-thought format, the agent can execute both simple and complex combinations of function calls needed to execute a task.\n","\n","From there, the function calls can be parsed into a dependency graph, and executed. Then, the values in the CoA are replaced with their actual results. As an extension to the original paper, the agent also run the LLM a final time, to rewrite the response in a more readable and user-friendly way.\n","\n","Original paper:[Efficient Tool Use with Chain-of-Abstraction Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17464)\n","\n","Original code from Llama-index: https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/agent/coa_agent/\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Setup"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["The libraries to install"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["!pip install llama-index-core llama-index-llms-openai llama-index-embeddings-openai\n","!pip install llama-index-packs-agents-coa"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import os\n","\n","# NOTE: This is ONLY necessary in jupyter notebook.\n","# Details: Jupyter runs an event-loop behind the scenes.\n","#          This results in nested event-loops when we start an event-loop to make async queries.\n","#          This is normally not allowed, we use nest_asyncio to allow it for convenience.\n","import nest_asyncio\n","\n","nest_asyncio.apply()\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Load the API Keys:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"id":"gIiPgcBGrKFI"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["True"]},"execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["from dotenv import load_dotenv\n","\n","# Load the enviroment variables\n","load_dotenv()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Import the Libraries"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["from llama_index.core import Settings\n","from llama_index.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbedding\n","from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI\n","from llama_index.core.tools import QueryEngineTool\n","from llama_index.packs.agents_coa import CoAAgentPack\n","\n","from llama_index.core import SimpleDirectoryReader, VectorStoreIndex\n","from llama_index.core import StorageContext, load_index_from_storage\n","from llama_index.core.node_parser import SentenceSplitter"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Load the data and create the indexes"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["For this demo, we are going to extract information from a document about census in Spain in 2023 and the other document describes the census and population figures for the EU in 2023.

However, given the substantial figure reported for Spain, it suggests that Spain's increase was notably significant, potentially surpassing the average increase rate in the EU, especially if the EU's total increase translates into a smaller absolute number when distributed across its much larger population base.
